Six weeks... When you read "six weeks," it doesn't seem like that long of a time.  Just typing it right now is surprising me, but it was just six weeks ago that I began the first module at Turing.  I knew little to nothing about Ruby and object-oriented programming.  Now, just six weeks later, I'm writing this post and getting ready to begin the second module of this course.

In the span of that month-and-a-half, my classmates and I built everything from a terminal-based to Battleship game to a database that sifted through thousands of lines of information.

Not only did I learn a lot about coding and the Ruby language, I have also learned a lot about learning and growing.  I have learned that being challenged is not a sign of weakness and asking for help is not the same as admitting failure.

Now, the focus shifts from local application development to web-based development, and I can't wait to see what challenges await me in the coming six weeks.
