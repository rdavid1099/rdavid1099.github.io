I joined enrolled in the Turing School of Software and Design's back-end program in June of 2016.

Before Turing, I spent five years as a news producer, creating local news content for stations in Denver, CO, Portland, OR, and Alexandria, LA.  While the thrill of working in television was exciting for a period of time, I eventually wanted more of a challenge.  That's what led me to Turing.

I have dabbled with coding languages when I was younger, learning basic HTML formatting and JavaScript in high school.  Now, with the help of the instructors and supportive student body at Turing, I am building on my passion for sleek, exciting code to become an asset for the country's workforce.
